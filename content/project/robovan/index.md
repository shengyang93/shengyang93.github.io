### Robovan: Large-Scale Autonomous Cargo Transportation

We have successfully launched hundreds of GT Unmanned Vehicles in Weifang, Shandong, achieving one of the largest real-world deployments of autonomous cargo transportation in an open urban environment. These vehicles operate continuously on public roads, providing point-to-point cargo delivery services between customers, in a mode similar to ride-hailing platforms such as DiDi and Uber - but designed specifically for freight and logistics.

Robovan’s competitiveness is not defined by a single algorithm or hardware choice, but by a **system-level design** that tightly integrates safety, autonomy, operations, and local execution. Below we summarize the key pillars that enable large-scale deployment.

### 1. Entrance - Road Access and Safety First

Road Access (i.e., to be granted by local goverments) is the initial constraint for autonomous vehicles operating in real cities. Our Robovans are designed with a safety-first philosophy that prioritizes predictable, conservative behavior to meet regulatory requirements and public acceptance.

However, safety is a double-edged sword. Overly conservative policies can lead to inefficiencies: frequent stops, low average speed, poor user experience, and reduced asset utilization. Our solution is not to relax safety constraints, but to engineer safety through redundancy:

1. Redundant operational monitoring and remote assistance;
2. Redundant perception across sensors and models;
3. Redundant decision pathways for fallback behaviors;
4. Redundant infrastructures ensuring systematical failure case degrations.

This layered redundancy allows Robovans to remain safe without becoming paralyzed, enabling steady operation in complex, mixed-traffic urban roads.

### 2. Execution - AI meets Scenario and Scale Expansion

1. Core Ability: Smooth End-to-End Driving Algorithm under Non-Exhaustive Scenarios
2. Fast Deployment: Rapid Deployment via Lightweight Map Solutions

### 3. Experience - Human Vehicle Interaction


### 4. Profit - Dispatching and ETA-aware Docking Section


### 0. Local Operations

Large-scale autonomy does not succeed on algorithms and techniques alone. A critical but often overlooked component is localized operations, or what inappropriately called “Dirty Works.” This includes but not limits to:

1. Clear separation and coordination of Segment A (autonomous driving) and Segment B (human-assisted operations);
2. On-site maintenance, emergency handling, and fleet hygiene;
3. Product tailoring for local regulations and customer needs；
4. Cargo safety mechanisms (loading constraints, anti-theft, sealing).

By embedding these operational realities directly into product and system design, RoboVan achieves sustainable, long-term operation, rather than fragile demos.
