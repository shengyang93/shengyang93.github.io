### GX - The "Last Three Kilometers" Solution for Closed Parks

On September 17, 2020, at the Yunqi Conference, Alibaba unveiled its first logistics unmanned vehicle, the “Small Savage Donkey.” By March 31, 2023, the fleet had expanded to more than 700 vehicles, operating across over 20 provinces and serving more than 400 colleges and universities, with a cumulative total of over 30 million delivery orders completed.

Behind the “Small Savage Donkey” is a full stack of intelligent technologies, including multi‑sensor fusion perception (LiDAR, cameras, and GNSS), high‑precision positioning and mapping, and robust path planning algorithms that handle complex campus and urban environments. Onboard edge computing enables real‑time decision‑making for obstacle avoidance and safe interaction with pedestrians, while cloud‑based scheduling and fleet management systems optimize routing, charging, and task allocation at scale. Together, these capabilities allow the vehicle to operate reliably in diverse scenarios, significantly improving last‑mile logistics efficiency and service quality.

### GT - L4 Autonomous Delivery: Revolutionizing City-Scale Logistics

After the mass‑production of the GX, our team independently designed and developed the next‑generation unmanned vehicle on September, 2023, namely CaiNiao GT, a fully driverless logistics robot built on advanced end-to-end autonomous‑driving technologies. It can intelligently plan routes, dynamically avoid obstacles and potential hazards, and operate safely and efficiently on complex urban roads to complete tens of killometers transportation tasks with high reliability.

With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, we are continuously optimizing and simplifying our sensor and computing hardware configurations, to reduce the overall Bill of Materials (BOM) when we are ready, while maintaining efficiency–safety performance and strengthening our commercial competitiveness.

In particular, by upgrading our off‑board visual reconstruction and on‑board visual ranging capabilities, we have implemented an innovative sensor configuration that, for the first time in urban‑road logistics scenarios, uses a single LiDAR and eleven cameras. This new setup replaces the previous four‑LiDAR, eight‑camera solution, yet achieves a similarly low incidence of risky behaviors, and maintains robust performance at night and under severe weather conditions.
