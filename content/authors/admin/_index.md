## About Me

I am currently the Founder and Head of NIO AI Research, working closely with [Prof. Shaoqing Ren](https://shaoqingren.com/) on the cutting-edge autonomous driving architectures and algorithms.

Before joining NIO, I served as a Director of the Alibaba Autonomous Driving Lab, where I was responsible for the overall algorithmic architecture, perception, generative reconstruction, and SLAM. Sponsored by [CaiNiao CTO Qiang Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiang-li-37196013), I successfully launched the Robovan project, with all L4 unmanned vehicles equipped with our RTMap solution, resulting in millions of successful deliveries for customers.

I completed my Ph.D. at the [Graphics and Geometric Computing Group](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Shi-Min Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/prof_hu.htm). Earlier, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University, ranking first in our grade.
