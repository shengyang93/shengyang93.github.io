## About Me

I serve as a Director of the Perception Department at [Cainiao Unmanned Vehicle](https://www.cainiao.com/technology-unmanned-vehicles.html), where I led an effort on autonomous driving architecture, data efficiency techniques, and frontier algorithms. I received my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Shi-Min Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/prof_hu.htm).

> 🍀 We are continually seeking experienced colleagues and passionate research interns to collaborate with. Feel free to contact me.
